"""semanticdiff — read a git history of an RDF file as semantic change.

A git diff reports characters. This package reports the vocabulary: which
classes, properties and concepts were added, modified, renamed, deprecated or
removed in each commit, so the raw text only has to be opened when the summary
is not enough.

It deliberately depends on nothing from `ster` — an import contract enforces
that — so it can be extracted into its own distribution unchanged.
